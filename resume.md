## Summary

A growth and results driven Sitecore and Azure Solutions Architect with experience in pursuit; medium to large-scale digital experience platform implementations; managed services and devops practice development along with over 10 years of experience in the healthcare, travel and legal industries.

I'm looking for opportunities to flex my expertise in Sitecore and Azure, allowing clients and partners to realize their full investment in their technology platforms.
